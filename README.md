# CAST: Candidate Alert System for Transients

**CAST** is a Target and Observation Manager (TOM) system designed to manage and follow up on astronomical transient candidates from the Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST; [Ofek et al. 2023]([url](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023PASP..135f5001O/abstract))). It builds on the [TOM Toolkit](https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_base) and adds custom functionality such as a scanning page for the survey through the **Candidates** app.

> 📦 Migrating an existing (non-docker) CAST deployment onto this dockerized version? See [importing-legacy-cast.md](importing-legacy-cast.md).

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Install a Base TOM System

First, install a basic TOM system by following the instructions at:  
👉 https://github.com/TOMToolkit/tom_base

This sets up a Django-based TOM project that CAST builds upon.

---

### 2. Install the `candidates` App

Once your TOM base project is running, install the `candidates` application:

1. **Copy or clone the `candidates` app** into your TOM project directory.

   If you want to work with git, perform the following commands from your TOM directory:
   ```
   git init .
   git remote add origin git@github.com:erezimm/CAST.git
   git pull origin master 
   ```

3. **Add it to your Django `INSTALLED_APPS`** in `settings.py`:

   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       # ... existing apps
       'candidates',
       'LAST',
       'FP',
   ]
2. **Run database migrations**:
   ```python
   python manage.py makemigrations candidates
   python manage.py migrate

### 3. Update `settings.py` Configuration

1. **Add the path to the transient folder to your `settings.py`**:
   ```python
   # Transients settings
   TRANSIENT_DIR = '/path/to/transients/'  # Change this to your actual directory
   ```
2. **Add your Transient Name Server (TNS) credentials**:
   ```python
   BROKERS = {
     'TNS': {
        'api_key': '',
        'bot_id': '',
        'bot_name': '',
      ...

    },
   ```
   **NOTE**: For development, update the wis-tns urls to sandbox.wis-tns.org:
   
   In the file `candidates/models.py`, find and replace `www.wis-tns.org` with `sandbox.wis-tns.org` (2 occurences)

3. **Add LAST_DB for Observation page and FORCED_PHOTOMETRY_DB **:
   ```python
   LAST_DB = {
    'host': '',  # host of last0
    'port': ,
    'username': '', 
    'password': ''
    },

   FORCED_PHOTOMETRY_DB = {
      'host': '', # host of euclid
      'port': '',
      'username': '', 
      'password': '',
      'CAST_user_id': , 
   }
  ```

4. **For Observation page - make sure you set both STATIC dirs to the same path**:
   ```python
   STATIC_URL = '/static/'
   STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
   STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '_static')]  # make sure STATICFILES_DIR does not contain STATIC_ROOT
  ```

### 4. Update `urls.py` file
Make sure you have the `django` imports and the `about/` and `candidates/` paths in `urlpatterns`
   ```python
   from django.urls import path, include
   from django.views.generic import TemplateView

   urlpatterns = [
       path('', include('tom_common.urls')),
       path('about/', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='about.html'), name='about'),
       path('candidates/', include('candidates.urls')),  # Include URLs for the candidates app
       path('LAST/', include('LAST.urls')),  # Include URLs for the LAST app
       path('FP/', include('FP.urls')),
   ]
   ```

### 5. Final Steps

1. **Collect static files:**
   ```python
   python manage.py collectstatic
   
2. **Run the development server:**
   ```python
   python manage.py runserver

3. **Create plots directory for Observation page**
   In your TOM  directory, enter '_statc' folder and create the subfolers '_statc\LAST\plots'. 
   
Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser to use the application.

## Large file bootstrap

Large reference files under `app/large_files/` can be fetched automatically by Docker Compose before the app starts.

1. Copy `large_files_manifest.example.json` into `large_files_manifest.json`.
2. Replace placeholder URLs, headers, and destination paths with your real file sources.
3. Run `docker compose up`.

The one-shot `download-large-files` service reads the manifest, downloads any missing files, optionally extracts a ZIP member to a second location, and then the Django services continue. Existing files are skipped by default.
